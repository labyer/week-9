How can we improve bicyle safety in Philadelphia? - Highlight city fatalities by mapping crash locations and showing data on the victime, giving a name and story to the victim so they are seen as a person and not just a statistic.

Create a webb-map similar to WYNC Mean Streets website for Philly. Using data on fatalities fromthe Philadelphia Police Department and Bicycle Coalition.

The Aplication:
 

    the simple interface with the icons for the victim type.
    the ability to input more details regarding the victim.
    the ability to sort fatalities by borough and victim type.
    the bar that shows the percentage when using the sort feature (i.e. % child victims).
    the links to news stories about the crash.
    the street view picture showing the approximate location of the crash.
    in Philadelphia we would use City Council District rather than borough
    include a small map with the street view 
    include a separate searchable overall map

I envision the standard map/sidebar layout. The map shows the location points with different icons indicating victim type. Filters to view various attributes (gender, type of crash, age, etc.). Clicking on a point brings up the crash information in the sidebar.
